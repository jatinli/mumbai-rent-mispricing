"""
Pluggable scraper interface.

Every site adapter (e.g. scrape/magicbricks.py) implements ScraperAdapter so
the rest of the pipeline never needs to know which source produced a listing
— it only needs rows in the canonical schema defined by
rentlens.data.generate.validate_schema.

CachedFetcher is the shared HTTP layer all adapters should use. It enforces
the non-negotiable scraping rules for this project:
  - every raw response is cached to disk (data/raw/<source>/...) before
    anything is parsed, so a crash mid-run never loses work and a re-run
    never re-fetches a page it already has (resumability)
  - a minimum delay is enforced between *live* requests (cache hits are free)
  - an honest, identifiable User-Agent is sent on every request
